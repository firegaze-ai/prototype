# Wildfire smoke detector

This project demonstrates a wildfire smoke detection system powered by [YOLO v5 object detection](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app.

The model was trained partially using the [AI for Mankind](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/wildfire-smoke) smoke dataset, and partially using manually labeled images scavenged from the web, including some of [Hans-Werner Braun's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtUctWtBfHV2mA-VD_ti8cQ) videos on YouTube.
